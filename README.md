LCD Button Listener for Adafruit CharLCDPlate 16x2

This project requires pydispatcher in order to send signals from the listener loop into the main script.

Included is a test.py script that will connect the signals for each button being pushed/released and update the display
accordingly on the Adafruit_CharLCDPlate
